      summary: Charge
      description: |-
        Charges a card represented by a card nonce or a customer's card on file.

        Your request to this endpoint must include _either_:

        - A value for the `card_nonce` parameter (to charge a card nonce generated
        with the `SqPaymentForm`)
        - Values for the `customer_card_id` and `customer_id` parameters (to charge
        a customer's card on file)

        In order for an e-commerce payment to potentially qualify for
        [Square chargeback protection](https://squareup.com/help/article/5394), you
        _must_ provide values for the following parameters in your request:

        - `buyer_email_address`
        - At least one of `billing_address` or `shipping_address`

        When this response is returned, the amount of Square's processing fee might not yet be
        calculated. To obtain the processing fee, wait about ten seconds and call
        [RetrieveTransaction](#endpoint-retrievetransaction). See the `processing_fee_money`
        field of each [Tender included](#type-tender) in the transaction.
